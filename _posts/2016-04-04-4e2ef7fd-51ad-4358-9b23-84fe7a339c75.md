I started the 'Course' as it's called in short almost 15 years ago.  I never finished it, but I started again in January of this year.  I'm on Lesson/Day \#71 and am excited and in awe around the transformations that continue to occur in my life each day.  I feel like I am talking with Jesus as I read each lesson.
