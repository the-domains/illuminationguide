What if we started asking different questions?  For as long as I can recall, I just seem to notice what is wrong in the world.  I walk into a room and I notice what is out of place.  I walk around nature and I notice what seems out of flow.  Now, some might say that is a gift and I've used this gift to solve problems all my life.  Yet, seeing what is broken in the world doesn't bring out the best in the world.  I started the "Course in Miracles" earlier this year and have been reading many other spiritual texts.  In my meditation one morning, it occurred to me that I just needed to start asking different questions.  Not only did I need to start asking myself different questions, but I needed to start asking others around me different questions.  I've shifted my questions at the dinner table and with others to be things like:

What did you notice that was beautiful today?

What did you do to help someone today?

How did you make someone smile today?

What was the best thing that happened to you today?

Where did you find joy today?

Where did you find peace today?

These questions have shifted my view of the world.  Are you willing to shift yours?  What if it's as simple as asking ourselves different questions?
