 </p><p>I am an explorer.  I grew up in a small town in central Illinois where I had the opportunity to wander and explore as only you can do in a town of 2500 people.  My brother and I were always outside adventuring, wandering down by a creek or out riding our bikes to see what we could find.  My parents allowed us the freedom to discover who we were.  As a family, we spent many weekends in our travel trailer enjoying the outdoors, which began my love for nature and especially the trees!  I would sleep outside in my little tent as a teenager so that I could hear the sounds of the trees and enjoy the peace and quiet of the stillness of the night.  While we didn’t adventure outside of the state of Illinois until I was in High School, my adventure after that was just to begin.  Out of college, I moved to Atlanta, GA where I lived for 5 years and then to Portland, OR where I spent 14 years, after that Texas for 3 years and now Arizona.  During my time in Portland, I had the opportunity while working for Nike to see many countries including The Netherlands, Turkey, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and India.  Vacations have allowed me to explore Mexico and many other states in the US.  I love finding the best local eatery and enjoying a cup of coffee or glass of wine while experiencing the local culture.  </p><p>As an explorer, I have tried many different modalities of healing along my path of healing and self improvement.  As an athlete when I was young playing basketball and softball, my body had many injuries, some small, some not.  I’ve always been an extreme introvert and someone who thinks and analyzes things deeply.  My grade school years were spent in a small 2 room parochial Christian school where I challenged my teachers to explain the creation story in the Bible or how did Jesus really heal people.  At some point, I realized that they just had faith in what they had learned, but they couldn’t truly explain it.  I think that is where my determination began to understand how things really work, who is ‘God’, what is spirituality, what is energy, how do we heal and what is our purpose here.  </p><p>In my early twenties, someone introduced me to the ‘Seth Material’ by Jane Roberts.  I think it was my first real experience of knowledge that was so far outside of what I had known that I realized that I had much more to learn.  I continued exploring and reading books about Budhism, Taoism, Sikhism, New Age this and New Age that!  Over the years, I accumulated quite the library of other people’s teachings on spirituality.  I spent years in analytical therapy, attended many of T Harv Eker’s workshops, like the Millionaire Mind, completed and then volunteered extensively with Matt Garrigan’s Liberty Experience and Mastery Courses, Courses from Nithyananda, sat with Amma along with numerous other classes and events.  While in Portland, I worked with several different naturopaths, acupuncturists, energy workers and healers.  I completed my Reiki certification and learned Eric Vormanns’ etheric healing.  I’ve been a meditator for the past 15 years always exploring the silence along with techniques from Nithyananda, Jeddah Mali, Ilchi Lee, Tara Brack and many more.</p><p>Today, I spend my spiritual explorations in the Akashic Records, the teachings of St Germain and Jeshua.  I'm a student of the Course in Miracles and learning every day!  I find time every day to meditate and connect with my 'I AM'.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="29"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="30">About Sheila Franzen</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
